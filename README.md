## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

CSS Fundamentals: By building this website using vanilla CSS, I was able to reinforce my understanding of the basics of CSS, such as the box model, selectors, and the use of different properties and values.

CSS Grid: I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout without the use of a front-end framework such as Bootstrap. I was able to create a grid system to place the testimonial blocks, which allowed me to control their placement and size.

Custom Styling: I learned how to create custom styles for my website, rather than relying on pre-existing styles from a framework. This gave me more control over the design and allowed me to create a unique look for my website.

Problem-solving: By working with vanilla CSS, I was able to sharpen my problem-solving skills, as I had to find creative solutions to common web design challenges without the aid of pre-built components.

Browser Compatibility: I gained a deeper understanding of how to make sure my website works across different browsers and devices, which is essential for building accessible and user-friendly websites.

### Continued development

As a committed web developer, I am dedicated to expanding my skills and knowledge in both vanilla CSS and modern front-end technologies. I have honed my CSS skills by building websites without the use of front-end frameworks, and I am eager to further develop my expertise in this area.

In addition, I am eager to branch out into the world of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By combining my strong CSS skills with my ability to work with React, I am confident in my ability to create dynamic and interactive websites that meet the needs of modern web users.

With a focus on continued learning and professional growth, I am excited to explore new challenges and opportunities in the field of web development.
